            What special features have you done or attempted in creating the
            website?
          </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Used PHP to interact with a MySQL database to store and retrieve
              status data
            </li>
            <li>
              Created separate pages for posting status, searching status, and
              displaying search results
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Which part(s) did you have trouble with? </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              At first, I had trouble with setting up the database and
              connecting to it through PHP, but I fixed the code as it had
              errors in syntax
            </li>
            <li>
              I also struggled with creating the search functionality that would
              correctly match the search string to the status column in the
              database, but with some googling I figured it out
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> What would you like to do better next time? </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I would like to improve the user interface and design of the
              website to make it look better, as I didn't use CSS for this
              assignment as Im not confident in using it
            </li>
            <li>
              I would also like to add more advanced features such as the
              ability to comment on status updates, or even edit old status
              updates
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              I learned how to use PHP to interact with a MySQL database to
              store and retrieve data, as It took me a while to figure out how
              to connect to the database
            </li>
            <li>
              I also learned some sql functions to help with my code and any
              queries
            </li>
            <li>During this project, I used the following resources:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I used W3Schools for HTML and PHP syntax
                (https://www.w3schools.com/)
              </li>
              <li>
                I also used Stack Overflow for any problems I encountered with
                my code (https://stackoverflow.com/)
              </li>
              <li>
                I looked at the PHP Manual for syntax help as well
                (https://www.php.net/manual/en/)
